Description: Network event daemon for systemd-networkd and NetworkManager
 netevd is a high-performance network event daemon written in Rust that
 configures network interfaces and executes scripts on network events from
 systemd-networkd, NetworkManager DBus signals, or when dhclient gains a lease.
 .
 Features:
  * Async/Await architecture built on tokio for efficient event handling
  * Multiple network manager support (systemd-networkd, NetworkManager, dhclient)
  * Routing policy rules for multi-interface setups
  * Script execution on network state changes
  * Runs as unprivileged user with minimal capabilities (CAP_NET_ADMIN only)
  * Real-time monitoring with sub-100ms event latency via netlink
  * Input validation with defense-in-depth against command injection
