# LinkedIn Post - netevd v0.1.0 (Short Version)

---

🚀 **Just released: netevd v0.1.0 - A network event daemon written in Rust!**

I'm excited to share netevd, an open-source tool that brings modern network management to Linux systems. Built with Rust for performance and safety, it monitors network events from systemd-networkd, NetworkManager, and dhclient.

**Why netevd?**

⚡ Sub-100ms event latency with minimal resource usage (3-5 MB RAM)
🔒 Security-hardened: runs as unprivileged user with minimal capabilities
🛣️ Automatic routing policy rules for multi-interface setups
🔌 Execute custom scripts on network state changes

**Perfect for:**
- Multi-homed servers
- Dynamic DNS updates
- VPN route automation
- Container/VM networking

**Get Started:**
```bash
cargo install netevd
```

Also available as RPM, DEB, and AUR packages.

🦀 crates.io: https://crates.io/crates/netevd

If you're managing Linux infrastructure, I'd love to hear your use cases and feedback. PRs welcome!
